The stock account was opened in the name of my Aunt: USHA SHARMA as she holds an Indian Citizenship and I wanted to trade Indian Stocks.

The company list was sorted with the criteria of: Traded Volume, Market Capitalization, Price Point and Reputation and Intraday Allowance among others.

The legacy code folder contains codebase that helped me develop and test strategies(some worked, some did not).
