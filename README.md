Introduction

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository. Here, I explore various aspects of investing and share my experience in developing a risk-tolerance-based investment framework. As a former retail trader, I used modeling techniques, engineering, and algorithms to build trading strategies.

My Journey to Understanding Risk Tolerance


Understanding one's risk tolerance is crucial for successful investing. I embarked on a personal journey to discover my risk tolerance by studying historical market data, analyzing my reactions to market fluctuations, and seeking advice from financial experts. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into my risk appetite and built an investment approach that aligns with my financial goals and temperament.


I spent the majority of my time coming up with strategies like Trend Trading, Mean Reversion, Gap Trading. It gave me a false sense of being an intellectual because it involved a fair bit of Mathematics, Programming and Data Visualization. I also tried to model some physics into the system as well. I did parallel programming and dabbled with the idea of using multiple smartphones to pull data from Yahoo Finance bypassing my daily limit set by Yahoo. I falsely assumed Jim Simmons over at Renaissance Technologies started out using TA in the beginning for predicting the market. I learnt about the scientific gambling methods like Kelly Criteria. I understood the concept of Risk Management and stop losses and tried to make an automated system for it as well. 

In the end I did make a fully automated system that told me when to buy a stock although the basis of it was all wrong(In my opinion Technical Analysis has no edge to it). I spent so much time thinking TA was right that I was biased from the get go.

My Framework as a Former Retail Trader


As a trader, my focus was on short-term to mid-term, low-cost investment strategies. I used a combination of Python, Pandas, and financial libraries like Pandas-Datareader and Yahoo Finance to collect historical market data and analyze various investment opportunities. The core principles of my trading framework include:

Gap Trading Strategy: I leverage price gaps (open and former close) to identify potential buying or selling opportunities in certain market conditions.

Mean Reversion Strategy: I explore the mean reversion concept, combining Bollinger Bands, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) to identify potential reversal points in stock prices.

Trend Trading Strategy: I use Heiken Ashi charts and trend analysis to identify stocks with strong price trends.

Lowest Point Strategy: This strategy involves identifying stocks that have reached their recent lowest points, using a combination of momentum and technical indicators.

Key Python Libraries Utilized


I utilize several powerful Python libraries to aid my research and analysis, including:

Scipy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Pandas-Datareader
YFinance
MySQL Connector
Talib
Numpy
BeautifulSoup
Requests
Csv
Statistics
itertools
Winsound (for sound notifications)
