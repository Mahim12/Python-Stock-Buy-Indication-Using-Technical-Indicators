# Stock-Market-Analysis-Using-Technical-Indicators
Backend: Python
Frontend: PHP

I spent the majority of my time coming up with strategies like Trend Trading, Mean Reversion, Gap Trading. It gave me a false sense of being an intellectual because it involved a fair bit of Mathematics, Programming and Data Visualization. I also tried to model some physics into the system as well. I did parallel programming and dabbled with the idea of using multiple smartphones to pull data from Yahoo Finance bypassing my daily limit set by Yahoo. I falsely assumed Jim Simmons over at Renaissance Technologies started out using TA in the beginning for predicting the market. I learnt about the scientific gambling methods like Kelly Criteria. I understood the concept of Risk Management and stop losses and tried to make an automated system for it as well. 

In the end I did make a fully automated system that told me when to buy a stock although the basis of it was all wrong(In my opinion Technical Analysis has no edge to it). I spent so much time thinking TA was right that I was biased from the get go. I wasnâ€™t making money and it really took a toll on me.
